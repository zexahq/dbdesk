## 📥 Installation

Download the latest installer for your platform from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/zexahq/dbdesk/releases) page.

### macOS

If you encounter issues with macOS Gatekeeper blocking the app (since it is not signed with an Apple developer certificate), you can bypass this by running the following command in your terminal after installation:

```bash
xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/dbdesk.app
```

After running this command, you can launch the app.

### Linux

Download the `.AppImage` file from the releases page. Make it executable and run:

```bash
chmod +x dbdesk-*.AppImage
./dbdesk-*.AppImage
```

### Windows

Download and run the installer from the releases page. The installer will handle setup automatically.
